First of all, I loaded the dataset and looked at the information and statistics of the columns in the dataset. Since the dataset was clean, I decided that there was no missing data or outlier data. My goal was to calculate the RFM scores of each customer in the dataset and group them together. 

In this way, I was able to see when each customer last shopped, how many times they shopped and how much money they spent in total. I explained step by step what I did on the KNIME platform for all these operations and finally grouped customers into 5 different categories according to their RFM scores. 

Finally, I visualized the whole study with bar chart and pie chart. As I said, since this study is a simple analysis, I did not use any machine learning model on it.
