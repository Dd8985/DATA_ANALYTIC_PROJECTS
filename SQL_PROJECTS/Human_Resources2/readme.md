This study, like my other SQL study, is an example that was worked on for the sole purpose of developing myself and practicing. Similarly, I used the JOB_HISTORY table for this study.

People who changed jobs were looked at from the job_history table.
People who are currently working but have never changed jobs in the past were looked at.
People who are not in the employees table but have worked in the past, that is, retired, were looked at.
And finally, instead of looking at them separately, I tried to see people who changed jobs, who did not change jobs, who are no longer working and retired in a single table.
