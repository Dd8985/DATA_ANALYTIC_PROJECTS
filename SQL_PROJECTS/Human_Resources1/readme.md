This is a study from when I first learned SQL. In order to improve myself, I worked with Human Resources tables (structured data about internal employees) which are often used.

I did operations such as pulling certain columns from the tables, detecting missing values or empty values on these pulled columns.

I performed certain filtering operations within the columns and extracted only the data suitable for the purpose.

When I wanted to increase salaries according to occupational groups, I ran it in a loop and added a new column to the table.

I did grouping using aggregation functions.

I combined several existing tables and analyzed them.

I continued my analysis with analytical SQL. 

In short, this work is quite simple and is an example that I made only to improve myself.
