This work was done entirely to improve myself and to learn the python programming language. The dataset here is an adult dataset directly from the UCI machine learning repository page. 
As it is known, all datasets there are clean and understandable, so no detailed cleaning has been done and no machine learning model has been developed in this project.
I would still like to talk about the process for the project;

The columns in the dataset were examined in detail using the info function and it was checked whether there were null values, whether data type conversion was required, and whether there were missing values.

The name of any arbitrarily selected column has been changed.

The statistical values of the numeric columns in the dataset were analyzed with the descsribe function.

The data set was checked for duplicate rows and duplicate rows were removed from the data set.

The use of apply and map functions is reinforced. 

grouping operations were performed according to the columns in the data set.

Finally, a detailed EDA study was performed on the dataset by performing ydata-profiling.

As I mentioned above, this project is a project I am working on to practice on python and no machine learning models and visualizations have been made.
